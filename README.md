# bayesian-optimisation
This repository features an analysis of Bayesian Optimization techniques applied to neutron scattering data. It explores the impact of prior knowledge on optimization, compares likelihood and posterior sampling methods, and applies Bayesian sampling to experimental data. Key libraries used include NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
