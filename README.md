# Bayesian Optimisation


## Overview

This project explores Bayesian Optimization, focusing on the use of likelihood and posterior sampling in Python. It investigates the role of prior knowledge in optimization, compares results between likelihood and posterior sampling, and demonstrates Bayesian sampling in experimental analysis.

## Project Goals

1. Implement likelihood and posterior sampling in Python.
2. Explore the influence of prior knowledge in optimization.
3. Compare outcomes from likelihood and posterior sampling methods.
4. Apply Bayesian sampling techniques to experimental data.

## Introduction 

### Context 

In this project, I extend probabilistic approaches to parameter optimization by incorporating noise propagation through sampling methods. Additionally, I integrate prior knowledge into the likelihood to enhance parameter estimation. This Bayesian modeling approach is pivotal in various machine learning models.

### Experiment

The project utilizes different datasets to illustrate and apply Bayesian Optimization concepts.
